## About

The purpose of this project was to build a multiple page photography e-commerce website.
The user is able to create an account, login, edit personal details and view order history.
There is a very nice and simple checkout experience to hopefully create repeat custom.
 
## UX

### User Stories
 
{{ uploaded user stories }}
 
 
### UI

* A responsive and sticky Navbar was essential, i decided to challenge to norm of having a top nav bar and go with a side nav, and bottom nav on mobile.
* A category selection was used to make it easier for shoppers to find the product they desire.
* Simplistic appealing forms to register, add personal details and checkout.
* An about page with a contact form for users to contact the site owner with queries about services and products.
* A loading page was implemented due to alot of images being used on the website to stop poor impressions from unloaded images.
* I decided a footer was not needed as any information was easily accessible at all times through the side/bottom Nav.
 
### Design

* The design for the site is simple and un-cluttered, giving it a nice clean look and feel.
* The colours of this site are inspired by dark mode, with both me and the site owner having a love for dark mode.
* The color pallet is as below:
    {{ color pallet }}
* All links and buttons have a hover effect.
* Text site uses a custom scrollbar and custom mouse, to give it that different feel.

### Database Schema

I put alot of time into the design of the database, however with this being my first time designing a relational database, i expected to run into unforseen issues.
My Database schema was first planned out roughly in notepad, and with the help of the site owner, we decided which parts were needed,
and what foreign keys were needed.
